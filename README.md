# authapp

A flutter project!

Uses Bloc with clean code architecture.

If you want to analyse and see vulnerabilities in the code run `flutter analyse`.

As the endpoints are in http, the network requests may not work as expected,
therefore I strongly recommend checking the app in debug mode.

To run the app in debug mode use  ----    `flutter run`

To run the app in release mode use --- `flutter run --release`
